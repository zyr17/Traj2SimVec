# Traj2SimVec
Some experiment codes of *Trajectory Similarity Learning with Auxiliary Supervision and Optimal Matching*

I only did some experiments of this paper. NO Traj2SimVec model implementation, only experiment data generation and result comparism codes. And implementation of one compared method *histogram*.

- **calcdis** implemented with C++, calculate distances between two vectors and between two trajectories
- **hist** cut area into small grids and count
- **ijcai_porto_data** scripts to generate embeddings with *.pt files
